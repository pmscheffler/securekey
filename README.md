# securekey

Code for article at https://devcentral.f5.com/s/articles/Securing-SSL-Keys-on-your-BIG-IP


The .json files are working files I used to bash through the jq queries throughout the code.  If you're not familiar with all jq can do, spend some time looking it over, it is IMPRESSIVE.

The .sh runs against a BIG-IP, I suggest not running it _ON_ the BIG-IP but I have modified a version of this to run locally.  Using ssh keys and accessing the BIG-IP remotely is a much safer method.

Looking forward to your feedback.
